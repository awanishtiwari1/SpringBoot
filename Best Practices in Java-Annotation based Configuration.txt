Some of the best practices that should be followed in Java-Annotation based configuration are:

Use specialized stereotypes and NOT generic stereotype
As you have seen previously, @Component is a 'generic' stereotype for any Spring-managed bean or component. We also derive @Service, @Repository and @Controller from @Component, which are 'specialized' stereotypes used for classes implementing Service, Persistence and Controller layers respectively.

@Component can be used interchangeably with any of the above derived specific stereotypes and there will not be any significant issue or complication to the application. However, it is a best practice to use the specific stereotypes for their respective layer implementations (which is @Service for Service Layer, @Repository for Persistence Layer and @Controller for Controller Layer).

        2.  Annotate ONLY classes and NOT interfaces

We should always annotate only the classes (and/or it's methods) and not the interface which it implements as Java does not allow the implementing classes to inherit the interfaces which are annotated. Hence, it is a good practice to avoid annotating the interfaces.
